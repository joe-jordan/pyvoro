======

3D Voronoi tessellations: a python entry point for the [voro++ library](http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/)

**Recently Added Features:**

*Released on PyPI* - thanks to a contribution from @ansobolev, you can now install the project with
`pip` - just type `pip install pyvoro`, with sudo if that's your thing.

*support for numpy arrays* - thanks to a contribution from @christopherpoole, you can now pass in
a 2D (Nx3 or Nx2) numpy array.

*2D helper*, which translates the results of a 3D tesselation of points on the plane back into
2D vectors and cells (see below for an example.)

*Radical (weighted) option*, which weights the voronoi cell sizes according to a set of supplied
radius values.

*periodic boundary support*, note that each cell is returned in the frame of reference of its source
point, so points can (and will) be outside the bounding box.

Installation
------------

Recommended - installation via `pip`:

    pip install pyvoro

Installation from source is the same as for any other python module. Issuing 
  
    python setup.py install
    
will install pyvoro system-wide, while 

    python setup.py install --user

will install it only for the current user. Any 
[other](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html#using-setup-py)  `setup.py` keywords 
can also be used, including 
 
    python setup.py develop
    
to install the package in 'development' mode. Alternatively, if you want all the dependencies pulled in automatically,  
you can still use `pip`:

    pip install -e .

`-e` option makes pip install package from source in development mode. 

You can then use the code with:

    import pyvoro
    pyvoro.compute_voronoi( ... )
    pyvoro.compute_3d_voronoi( ... )    
    pyvoro.compute_2d_voronoi( ... )

The compute_3d_voronoi method requires less memory than compute_voronoi and gives better control concerning the points to be considered for the tessellation and the properties to be retrieved for each Voronoi cell.

Example:
--------

```python
import pyvoro
pyvoro.compute_voronoi(
  [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.5, 6.0]], # point positions
  [[0.0, 10.0], [0.0, 10.0], [0.0, 10.0]], # limits
  2.0, # block size
  radii=[1.3, 1.4] # particle radii -- optional, and keyword-compatible arg.
)
```

returning an array of voronoi cells in the form:

```python
{ # (note, this cell is not calculated using the above example)
  'volume': 6.07031902214448,
  'faces': [
    {'adjacent_cell': 1, 'vertices': [1, 5, 8, 3]}, 
    {'adjacent_cell': -3, 'vertices': [1, 0, 2, 6, 5]},
    {'adjacent_cell': -5, 'vertices': [1, 3, 9, 7, 0]},
    {'adjacent_cell': 146, 'vertices': [2, 4, 11, 10, 6]},
    {'adjacent_cell': -1, 'vertices': [2, 0, 7, 4]},
    {'adjacent_cell': 9, 'vertices': [3, 8, 10, 11, 9]},
    {'adjacent_cell': 11, 'vertices': [4, 7, 9, 11]},
    {'adjacent_cell': 139, 'vertices': [5, 6, 10, 8]}
  ],
  'adjacency': [

    [9, 0, 4],
    [5, 3, 10],
    [11, 3, 7],
    [6, 8, 11],
    [10, 9, 4]
  ],
  'original': [1.58347382116, 0.830481034382, 0.84264445125],
  'vertices': [
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [2.6952010660213537, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 1.3157105644765856],
    [2.6796085747800173, 0.9893738662896467, 0.0],
    [0.0, 1.1577688788929044, 0.9667194826924593],
    [2.685575135451888, 0.0, 1.2139446383811037],
    [1.5434724537773115, 0.0, 2.064891808748473],
    [0.0, 1.2236852383897006, 0.0],
    [2.6700186049990116, 1.0246853171897545, 1.1392273839598812],
    [1.6298653128290692, 1.8592211309121414, 0.0],
    [1.8470793965350985, 1.7199178301499591, 1.6938166537039874],
    [1.7528279426840703, 1.7963648490662445, 1.625024494263244]
  ]
}
```

Note that this particle was the closest to the coord system origin - hence
(unimportantly) lots of vertex positions that are zero or roughly zero, and
(importantly) **negative cell ids** which correspond to the boundaries (of which
there are three at the corner of a box, specifically ids `1`, `3` and `5`, (the
`x_i = 0` boundaries, represented with negative ids hence `-1`, `-3` and `-5` --
this is voro++'s conventional way of referring to boundary interfaces.)

Initially only non-radical tessellation, and computing *all* information 
(including cell adjacency). Other code paths may be added later.

The `pyvoro.compute_3d_voronoi` method is similar to `pyvoro.compute_voronoi` but with minimal memory requirements and extra arguments controlling the points to be used for the tessellation and the properties of the Voronoi cells to be retrieved. The calculation is performed in a slightly different way so that the properties of each cell can be retrieved right after its identification. This may cause problems that can be avoided using the original `pyvoro.compute_vorono` method. The following list of properties can be retrieved for each cell:

```python
  [
    'original',  # corresponding point coordinates.
    'radius',    # corresponding point radius.
    'volume',    # cell volume.
    'surface',   # cell surfae.
    'rmaxsq',    # the maximum radius squared of a vertex from the center of the cell.
    'vertices',  # positions of cell verices.
    'normals',   # faces normal vectors.
    'areas',     # faces surface area.
    'adjacency', # for eaech cell-vertice the adjacent cell-vertices.
    'faces',     # for eaech cell-face its vertices and the corrsponding adjacent cel#.
    'neighbors'  # the neighbor cells.
  ]
```

If the properties argument is omitted the only the `'neighbors'` property will be retrieved while if it is an empty list, all the properties will be retrieved.

For example:
```python
import pyvoro
pyvoro.compute_3d_voronoi(
  [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.5, 6.0],[2.0, 2.0, 8.0],[7.5, 8.5, 9.0]],
  [[0.0, 10.0], [0.0, 10.0], [0.0, 10.0]],
  2.0, 
  radii=[1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 1.1],
  excluded=[False, False, False, True],
  properties=['volume','neighbors']
)
```
calculates the tessellation using the first four points and retieving only the `'volume'` and `'neighbors'` properties for the corresponding cells. The returned list of dictionaries should look like:
```python
[
  {
    'volume': 177.64722095982148, 
    'neighbors': (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2)
  }, 
  {
    'volume': 685.3951916480655, 
    'neighbors': (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0)
  }, 
  {
    'volume': 136.95758739211308, 
    'neighbors': (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
  },
  {} # empty dict for excluded points
]
```

2D tessellation
---------------

You can now run a simpler function to get the 2D cells around your points, with all the details
handled for you:

```python
import pyvoro
cells = pyvoro.compute_2d_voronoi(
  [[5.0, 7.0], [1.7, 3.2], ...], # point positions, 2D vectors this time.
  [[0.0, 10.0], [0.0, 10.0]], # box size, again only 2D this time.
  2.0, # block size; same as before.
  radii=[1.2, 0.9, ...] # particle radii -- optional and keyword-compatible.
)
```

the output follows the same schema as the 3D for now, since this is not as annoying as having a 
whole new schema to handle. The adjacency is now a bit redundant since the cell is a polygon and the
vertices are returned in the correct order. The cells look like a list of these:

```python
{ # note that again, this is computed with a different example
  'adjacency': [
    [5, 1],
    [0, 2],
    [1, 3],
    [2, 4],
    [3, 5],
    [4, 0]
  ],
  'faces': [
    { 'adjacent_cell': 23, 'vertices': [0, 5]},
    { 'adjacent_cell': -2, 'vertices': [0, 1]},
    { 'adjacent_cell': 39, 'vertices': [2, 1]},
    { 'adjacent_cell': 25, 'vertices': [2, 3]},
    { 'adjacent_cell': 12, 'vertices': [4, 3]},
    { 'adjacent_cell': 9, 'vertices': [5, 4]}
  ],
  'original': [8.168525781010283, 5.943711239620341],
  'vertices': [
    [10.0, 5.324580764844442],
    [10.0, 6.442713105218478],
    [9.088894888250326, 7.118847221681966],
    [6.740750220282158, 6.444386346261051],
    [6.675322891805883, 5.678806294642725],
    [7.77400067532073, 5.02320427474993]
  ],
  'volume': 5.102702932807149
}
```

*(note that the edges will now be indexed -1 to -4, and the 'volume' key is in fact the area.)*

NOTES:
* on compilation: if a cython .pyx file is being compiled in C++ mode, all cython-visible code must be compiled "as c++" - this will not be compatible with any C functions declared `extern "C" { ... }`. In this library, the author just used c++ functions for everything, in order to be able to utilise the c++ `std::vector<T>` classes to represent the (ridiculously non-specific) geometry of a Voronoi cell.
* A checkout of voro++ itself is included in this project. moving `setup.py` and the `pyvoro` folder into a newer checkout of the voro++ source may well also work, but if any of the definitions used are changed then it will fail to compile. by all means open a support issue if you need this library to work with a newer version of voro++; better still fix it and send me a pull request :)
